* Exercise 1.9: 

Each of the following two procedures defines a method for *adding* two positive
integers in terms of the procedures inc,
which increments its argument by 1, and dec, which decrements its argument by 1. 


#+BEGIN_SRC scheme

(define (+ a b)
 (if (= a 0)
   b
   (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(define (+ a b)
 (if (= a 0)
   b
   (+ (dec a) (inc b))))

#+END_SRC

Using the substitution model, 
illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5). 
Are these processes iterative or recursive? 


#+BEGIN_SRC scheme

(define (+ a b)
 (if (= a 0)
   b
   (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
(inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5))
(inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (6))))
(inc (inc (7)))
(inc (8))
